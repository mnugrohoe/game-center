# 🧩 Puzzle Game Collection

A collection of simple but popular online puzzle games built with Next.js.

This project focuses on three main components for every game:

- 🎮 Game implementation
- 🧠 Solver algorithm
- ⚙️ Puzzle generator

The purpose of this project is to explore game logic, algorithms, procedural generation, and optimization techniques through classic puzzle games.

- Playable web-based games
- Automatic puzzle solvers
- Random level generators
- Shared reusable algorithms
- Responsive UI
- Built with Next.js + TypeScript

# 🧠 Architecture

Every game contains 3 core modules:

## 1. Game

Responsible for:

- Game rules
- State management
- Rendering
- User interaction

---

## 2. Solver

Responsible for solving puzzles automatically using algorithms such as:

- BFS
- DFS
- A\*
- Backtracking
- Graph traversal
- Constraint solving

---

## 3. Generator

Responsible for creating valid and solvable puzzles.

Features:

- Random generation
- Difficulty balancing
- Solvability validation
- Puzzle randomization

---
